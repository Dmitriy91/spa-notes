It's a small SPA web app that I made to learn AngularJS(v1.5.5).
It allows you to store your personal notes.
I used John Papa's AngularJS style guide https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1 
The following frameworks and libraries were used:
-AngularJS v1.5.5,
-jQuery 2,
-Bootstrap 3,
-ASP.NET MVC 5(Core 1.0),
-WebAPI 2,
-Identity 2,
-Entity Framework 6,
-AutoMapper 4,
-NInject 3.
